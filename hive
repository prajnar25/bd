ROW FORMAT DELIMITED

STORED AS TEXTFILE;

hive > DESCRIBE student;

hive >INSERT INTO TABLE student
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 20, 'Engineering'),

(3, 'Michael Johnson', 21, 'Sales'),
(4, 'Emily Davis', 23, 'HR'),
(5, 'James Brown', 24, 'Finance');

SELECT * FROM student;

Since Hive doesn't support direct row deletion, we'll overwrite the table excluding the row you want to delete.
Hive >INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE student
SELECT * FROM student WHERE id != 2;

SELECT * FROM student;


ALTER TABLE student ADD COLUMNS(semester INT);   //By default NULL values are assigned for semester

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE student
SELECT id,name,age,department,'6' AS semester FROM student;

SELECT *FROM student;


DROP TABLE student;


DROP DATABASE database_usn;
